## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently enrolled in a **6-month Data Science & AI Bootcamp at Lux Dev HQ**, where I'm gaining hands-on experience in Python programming, SQL (PostgreSQL), data visualization with Power BI, and real-world analytics projects.

With a background in training, branding, and digital marketing, I bring a unique blend of storytelling, business acumen, and data curiosity into every project I work on.
